# QRAF API Service Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for exposing QRAF's quantum-enhanced capabilities as a FastAPI service, with CUDA acceleration, quantization, density optimization, error correction, and state network integration.

## Architecture Components

### 1. API Layer (FastAPI)
```python
# Core endpoints
POST /enhance      # Enhanced text generation
POST /memory      # Memory operations
POST /state       # State management
GET  /health      # Service health
GET  /metrics     # Performance metrics

# Advanced endpoints
POST /optimize    # Density optimization
POST /correct     # Error correction
POST /quantize    # State quantization
```

### 2. Acceleration Layer
```python
class CUDAAccelerator:
    # From cuda_utils
    - Fused attention operations
    - Parallel state processing
    - Memory-efficient gradients
    - Batch quantum operations
```

### 3. State Management
```python
class QuantumStateManager:
    # Core components
    - CompressiveMemory integration
    - Phase coherence tracking
    - Interference pattern management
    - State network routing
```

### 4. Processing Pipeline
